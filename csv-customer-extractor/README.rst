CSV Customer Extractor
======================

This repository contains a CSV file called `customer-orders.csv`
that includes information about customer orders, such as
`CustomerID`, `ArticleID`, `OrderID`, and `Timestamp`. The goal of
this project is to extract all unique CustomerIDs present in the CSV
file and generate a text file that lists these unique IDs.
